  <!-- This is where you might want to put your navigation menu in, right below your main heading.
       In the labsheet, it asks you to make three pages, so you need three links. 
       Each one is created with an <a> element, just like you've got further down. 
       With an <a> element, you need to tell the browser two things:
        1. What should be displayed on the page for the user to click/tap
        2. Where should the browser go when the user clicks/taps it

      We achieve the first with the content of the <a> element. That is, whatever we put between the 
opening and closing tags. For example, <a>I am a link</a> would display I am a link on the page, and that's
      what the user should click/tap on.

      For the second thing, we use the href attribute to tell the browser where to go. You've done this further 
      down where you're displaying the word Link as the thing the user clicks/taps on, and then the browser takes them to
      the bbc good food website. Good choice by the way.

      For links within your own website, it works in the same way. 

      If you have a file called about.html and you want to put a link on the page to go to it, you would write

<a href='about.html'>About</a>

      This would display the word About, and when the user clicks/taps on it, they would be taken to about.html

  <!-- This shouldn't really be a <h1>. By using this, you've said this is a heading with the same level
       level of importance as your main page heading. In fact, this probably doesn't want to be a heading at all,
       so a <p> element is probably more appropriate. -->
  
  <h1>Here is the recipe so you can try it yourself</h1>
<a href="https://bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/rainbow-cake">Link</a>
  
<!-- These two links will display nothing and go nowhere. A note on the use of # here: an <a> element will only be styled as such and clickable if it
     has a href attribute. There are times when you want the styling, but you don't want to actually go anywhere. Maybe you haven't created the page
     that it goes to yet. In these cases, using a # for the href will just reload the same page again. -->

    <!-- Aah, here's the viewport meta tag. As noted above, this should go in your <head> section.

         to be displayed on the page go in the <body> -->
